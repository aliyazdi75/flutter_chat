# flutter_chat

A full-featured (simple message, voice, video) flutter chat application
by SignalR and WebRTC.

![Flutter Chat Demo](./screenshots/demo.gif)

## Features

- Full Authentication service
- Bad request models and authentication validation from server (e.g.
  email, password, user exists)
- Storing authentication token
- On demand log-out (e.g. an unauthorized request)
- Chat list
- Chat page and simple chatting
- Communication between chat list and page Bloc
- Call Bloc which is responsible for before starting a call
- Full webRTC handshaking through SignalR (Offer, Answer, Candidate,
  HangUp, Reject)
- Camera and microphone functionality (e.g. switching camera, toggling
  camera and microphone and torch)
- All webRTC functionality are based on Bloc and suitable states and
  events
- All services communicate with their own providers
- All Blocs communicate with services through their repositories

## FAQs
- This application uses a free STUN and TURN server from
  [here](https://numb.viagenie.ca/) which just works well on local
  network. Please mention good STUN and TURN servers in the issue.
- The server source code is not open-source, but I will ask them to
  provide an open-source simple chatting. If you have time to make the
  server code with a simple user chatting and a simple socket handling,
  I will be delighted to integrate with the Flutter Chat.
